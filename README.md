# Enhanced Prompting Techniques with T5

## Project Description

This project demonstrates advanced prompting techniques using the T5 model to improve various NLP tasks. It includes several examples of different prompting methods such as few-shot prompting, in-context learning, chain of thought, and prompt chaining. The focus is on leveraging the T5 model (Flan-T5) to achieve better performance and accuracy in text generation tasks.

## Features

- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Examples include translation and sentiment analysis tasks using the T5 model.
- **In-Context Learning**: Fact-based and history Q&A examples to show the modelâ€™s ability to answer questions based on provided context.
- **Chain of Thought**: Logical reasoning and math problem-solving examples demonstrating step-by-step thought processes.
- **Prompt Chaining**: Multi-step tasks combining different types of prompts to obtain complex answers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Transformers library
- PyTorch

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```
